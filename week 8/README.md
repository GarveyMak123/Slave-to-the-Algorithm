# WEEK 8

### Project progress

This week, I started looking at how to get tweet data and perform sentiment analysis. In Karen's feedback, she shared The Coding Train's Introduction to Data and APIs in JavaScript tutorial.<br>

From this video, I learned that I need to get the Twitter API and import the API into Processing for data-related visualization.

### Twitter API

The Twitter [DEVELOPER](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/guide) page details how to get the API, so I tried to apply.

After applying to become a developer, I started researching how to get data and analyze sentiment.

[In this tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/twitter-sentiment-analysis-using-python/), I thought I had covered how to do sentiment analysis of tweets in great detail. But I realized that I need to learn Python because these tutorials are completely incomprehensible to me, and it feels like food is already on the table waiting for me to enjoy, but I don't know how to eat it...

OFFF Twitter Archive is a Twitter archive based on visualizations of Barcelona-based design and art festivals. In this work, over 4000 relevant tweets are recorded and displayed as A1 size posters. This is a special way of recording tweets, which are usually forgotten as time passes after people send tweets. But the OFFF Twitter Archive is fantastic for documenting these relevant tweets in paper form.
