# WEEK 8

### Project progress

This week, I started looking at how to get tweet data and perform sentiment analysis. In Karen's feedback, she shared The Coding Train's Introduction to Data and APIs in JavaScript tutorial.<br>

From this video, I learned that I need to get the Twitter API and import the API into Processing for data-related visualization.

### Twitter API

The Twitter [DEVELOPER](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/guide) page details how to get the API, so I tried to apply.
