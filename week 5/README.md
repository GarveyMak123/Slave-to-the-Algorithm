## Project Pitch & Research
Today's graphic designers are sometimes embarrassed by clients who don't understand the design process or don't know precisely what they need when they get a case. Therefore, I wanted to find out how to help designers become more efficient through generative design. Last week, I decided that my project concept would be about generative design in graphic design, and I wanted my project to be data-driven, either by inputting some images, text, and outputting a generative poster or tool for use in the graphic design field.

My concept so far, has been vague and not specific enough. This week, to continue developing my ideas, I will continue to look at generative design uses in graphic design.

### Research
1.Generative Covers
  
Team:<br>
Marcin Ignac / Variable concept + design + code<br>
Vladimir Kuchinov / Variable design + typography + code + documentation

The Polish NGO Center Cyfrowe contacted the Variable team to solve the problem of displaying the covers of CC books without a CC license. After getting the book's page count, year of publication, and category, the Variable team converted it into a generative cover. I think it is great about this tool because it is web-based and allows designers to input their data to experiment with covers.<br>

2. MIT Media Lab Identity

MIT Media Lab Identity is a stunning idea, a generative logo project that generates unique logos for each faculty, staff, and student. The logos all share the same style of shape and color and are instantly recognizable as part of the MIT Media Lab.<br>

3. 《Generative Design is Doomed to Fail》Daniel Davis – 20 February 2020<br>
https://www.danieldavis.com/generative-design-doomed-to-fail/<br>
I found the article "Generative Design is Doomed to Fail" to be a cautionary tale after reading the article. Author Daniel Davis attacks the fact that generative design creates hundreds of different proposal options, which increases the time and cost of making comparisons and choices.

## A tool
Inspired by Daniel Davis' article, I think it would be painful for a designer to have to choose between, for example, the MIT Media Lab Identity logo in a project to come up with a result.

Therefore, my project is not a direct result for the designer to choose from, as I fear this will be counterproductive, defeating helping designers be more efficient. My project's final concept is to create a tool that allows the designer to input images, text, and finally generate a poster or logo as a preview that will serve as inspiration for the designer.

### Similar Works & Tools：

1. Wiki-footwear

Wiki-footwear, which I discovered while wandering around the web, is a site that allows people to create their unique shoes, which are exported as a collage of images by searching for images related to the phrase. For example, if I type in cyberpunk, it will automatically search for images about the phrase and put the images into a collage of shoes. I think this is an excellent example of how to explain my project goal - preview!<br>

2.Open Images Dataset

Open Images Dataset is an example of an image search tool, such as typing in apples, and the result is an image containing apples. I think this tool is very useful for my project.<br>
