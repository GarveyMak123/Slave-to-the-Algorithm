## Project Pitch & Research
Today's graphic designers are sometimes embarrassed by clients who don't understand the design process or don't know precisely what they need when they get a case. Therefore, I wanted to find out how to help designers become more efficient through generative design. Last week, I decided that my project concept would be about generative design in graphic design, and I wanted my project to be data-driven, either by inputting some images, text, and outputting a generative poster or tool for use in the graphic design field.

My concept so far, has been vague and not specific enough. This week, to continue developing my ideas, I will continue to look at generative design uses in graphic design.
