## Project Pitch & Research
Today's graphic designers are sometimes embarrassed by clients who don't understand the design process or don't know precisely what they need when they get a case. Therefore, I wanted to find out how to help designers become more efficient through generative design. Last week, I decided that my project concept would be about generative design in graphic design, and I wanted my project to be data-driven, either by inputting some images, text, and outputting a generative poster or tool for use in the graphic design field.

My concept so far, has been vague and not specific enough. This week, to continue developing my ideas, I will continue to look at generative design uses in graphic design.

### Research
1.Generative Covers
  
Team:<br>
Marcin Ignac / Variable concept + design + code<br>
Vladimir Kuchinov / Variable design + typography + code + documentation

The Polish NGO Center Cyfrowe contacted the Variable team to solve the problem of displaying the covers of CC books without a CC license. After getting the book's page count, year of publication, and category, the Variable team converted it into a generative cover. I think it is great about this tool because it is web-based and allows designers to input their data to experiment with covers.<br>

2. MIT Media Lab Identity

MIT Media Lab Identity is a stunning idea, a generative logo project that generates unique logos for each faculty, staff, and student. The logos all share the same style of shape and color and are instantly recognizable as part of the MIT Media Lab.<br>
