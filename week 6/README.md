# WEEK 6

### Group discussion
Shortly after the class began, we broke into groups to discuss project-related techniques.

### Class Activities
As part of the classroom activity, we worked on a paper prototype to create a 2D paper model game. I think this is a great way to present the concept physically. Not just in the realm of generative design, but this also applies to my future assignments and even work.
