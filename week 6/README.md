# WEEK 6

### Group discussion
Shortly after the class began, we broke into groups to discuss project-related techniques.

### Class Activities
As part of the classroom activity, we worked on a paper prototype to create a 2D paper model game. I think this is a great way to present the concept physically. Not just in the realm of generative design, but this also applies to my future assignments and even work.

The FUSE* team has always strived to create stories and unique experiences to balance art, science, and technology.

EVERYTHING IN EXISTENCE guides the viewer through a different reality experience, feeling themselves as a part of existence. The work uses a combination of visual and sound. Data from viewer interaction, social networks, and sound is processed in real-time, meaning the work itself is continually changing and ultimately creates a connection with the viewer. From the video, I could feel a sense of mystery moving forward in my brain. I think it's the combination of the visual and the sound of the work that works.
