# WEEK 4
***
## In Class
***
we started learning how to import images and text to create in Processing.

### Image

First, we read the color values of any pixel on the imported image, and then we mapped those colors using randomly generated circles.

### Text

Adding fonts and rotating text

## Project Pitch & Research
With the general understanding of generative design from last week, I needed to develop a concept for my project this week. I wanted to create a graphic design project, so I researched the use of the generative design in graphic design today.

I noticed that Patrik Huebner is researching how to integrate data-driven, parametric and interactive approaches into communication design. His work has resulted in interactive 3D design, data-driven branding, and generative posters, among other things. This work has greatly expanded my horizons and made me feel that generative design possibilities are endless.


1. BRUTE is a wine brand with a data-driven approach to wind, rain, and sun. They visualize real-time weather data through particles, thus generating a visual image that is unpredictable and unique.

2. Pulse is a data-responsive graphic driven by real-time data from Twitter that responds to six themes under social conversations around women in leadership - Power, Success, Community, Diversity, Change, and Leadership. I think this work contributes significantly to the promotion of women's rights, and in work, the shapes and colors of the graphics change with the development of the themes and the mood of the subject matter to draw attention to those themes.

3. Based character-prototypes and chance to create intricate typographic poster designs. Created with Processing.

Inspired by these works, I wanted my project to be data-driven or input some images, text, and finally output generative posters or tools for the graphic design field.
