The Starfield is about visualizing sentiment data from twitter trends and hashtags. Firstly used trend24 to get the hashtags and trends of the tweets. The second step was to search these trends and hashtags using social media sentiment analysis tools to get sentiment analysis. Create Excel and record these trends, labels, and sentiments as data. Finally, import Excel in the processing and visualize the data as text motion.

In this project, I create a class to store trend and label objects. Each object has five attributes x, y, z, color, and string. Each object has two functions, update and display. The update is used to update each object's z coordinate to move forward in three dimensions. Finally, three fonts are assigned to the three mood colors in the processing. The last one is to add BGM. I use space music, just like universe.

Today in Twitter trends and hashtags, tweets and comments carry much emotion. These can affect how people think about things. I hope that the audience will question why the trend or label is blue in this work or why it is negative. This will inspire people to think independently and understand the truth behind things.


# Reflection

During the semester, I learned how to program basic code using PROCESSING. In my initial thoughts, my project plan was to use real-time data from Twitter and learn Python for data analysis. But I overlooked the difficulty of this and therefore spent a lot of time on it. So in the last three weeks, I used simple methods to get the data. Still, unfortunately, the data was not automatic and in real-time. After completing my project, I have a lot of regrets. Still, I am very grateful for the experience I gained in developing it.

Besides learning to program in the classroom, I also used to watch basic tutorials related to processing in The Coding Train. I've watched almost all of these basic tutorials while developing my projects. Many thanks to The Coding Train channel, which gave me a lot of help outside the classroom.

Finally, on my feelings about the project, I wasted a lot of time trying to work on real-time data acquisition and analysis, and I didn't end up mastering these skills. So I was very anxious during this time. And I missed the tenth week of the presentation. After I responded to Karen, I was very grateful for her understanding. In the future, I will continue to develop my project, and I plan to learn the relevant programming skills over the holidays in the hope that I will finish the project in the future.
