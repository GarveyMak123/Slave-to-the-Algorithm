# StarField
***



The Starfield is about visualizing sentiment data from twitter trends and hashtags. Firstly used trend24 to get the hashtags and trends of the tweets. The second step was to search these trends and hashtags using social media sentiment analysis tools to get sentiment analysis. Create Excel and record these trends, labels, and sentiments as data. Finally, import Excel in the processing and visualize the data as text motion.

In this project, I create a class to store trend and label objects. Each object has five attributes x, y, z, color, and string. Each object has two functions, update and display. The update is used to update each object's z coordinate to move forward in three dimensions. Finally, three fonts are assigned to the three mood colors in the processing. The last one is to add BGM. I use space music, just like universe.

Today in Twitter trends and hashtags, tweets and comments carry much emotion. These can affect how people think about things. I hope that the audience will question why the trend or label is blue in this work or why it is negative. This will inspire people to think independently and understand the truth behind things.
