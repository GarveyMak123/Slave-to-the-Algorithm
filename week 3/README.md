### Nonhuman Drawing

1. for my Nonhuman Drawing, I taped three markers together using duct tape. Since I didn't have any cords at home, I opted for a data cable as a substitute and taped it next to the window. With the help of the wind, I achieved my drawing.<br>

2. use a hairdryer to align the data lines and turn on the cold air.
