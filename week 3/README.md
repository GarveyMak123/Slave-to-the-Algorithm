### Nonhuman Drawing

1. for my Nonhuman Drawing, I taped three markers together using duct tape. Since I didn't have any cords at home, I opted for a data cable as a substitute and taped it next to the window. With the help of the wind, I achieved my drawing.<br>

2. use a hairdryer to align the data lines and turn on the cold air.

## Generative Design Research

In the early days most generative artists had a scientific background. And the plotter was the output device for generative art.<br>

From the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, generative artists began the rise of conceptualism. They asserted that the expression of artistic ideas was sufficient to become a work of art. One of the leading artists of this period was Ellsworth Kelly, who used the connection between abstraction and nature to infer form and color.<br>

#### New Wave

Casey Reas is one of the creators of the Process programming language. He explores ideas through the lens of software, and his work has a minimalist and conceptual style.<br>
