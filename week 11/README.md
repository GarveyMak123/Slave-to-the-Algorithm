### Progress before class feedback

In the last week, to test if my project would work. So use blue as neutral, green as positive, and red as negative. As the project progressed, I gradually began to study the effect of color on mood. So changed the colors and as a test, white for neutral, green for positive, and red for negative.<br>

### Feedback
In Andy and Karen's feedback, my project falls into the category of a proof of concept, which means I need to focus more on typography, color, sound, and interaction to achieve an emotional impact on the audience.

This week, I need to research fonts, colors, and sound effects. Also, the result of the combination of these elements is, I hope, restrained. I don't want the viewer to have a strong emotional impact and thus get a first impression of these trends and hashtags. I hope that the viewer sees my project and begins to think about why the trends and hashtags are positive or negative, and then searches for answers, at which point my goal is achieved. Because as the research progresses, the truth of the event gets closer and closer.
