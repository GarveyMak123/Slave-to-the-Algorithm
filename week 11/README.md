# WEEK 11
***
## Progress before class feedback

In the last week, to test if my project would work. So use blue as neutral, green as positive, and red as negative. As the project progressed, I gradually began to study the effect of color on mood. So changed the colors and as a test, white for neutral, green for positive, and red for negative.<br>

## Feedback
In Andy and Karen's feedback, my project falls into the category of a proof of concept, which means I need to focus more on typography, color, sound, and interaction to achieve an emotional impact on the audience.

This week, I need to research fonts, colors, and sound effects. Also, the result of the combination of these elements is, I hope, restrained. I don't want the viewer to have a strong emotional impact and thus get a first impression of these trends and hashtags. I hope that the viewer sees my project and begins to think about why the trends and hashtags are positive or negative, and then searches for answers, at which point my goal is achieved. Because as the research progresses, the truth of the event gets closer and closer.

## Font

I'm confused about how fonts play successfully in my projects. Even though I want to have some visual impact, I need to exercise restraint so that I don't overdo it. So I started researching fonts.

### Negative：<br>
In [Fonts & Feelings: Does Typography Connote Emotions?](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/typography-emotions) I found that the Impact font is very applicable to the trends and labels of negative emotions in projects. <br>

First, the impact font has the following characteristics:<br>
* Assertive 
* rigid
* sad
* unattractive
* coarse
* masculine<br>

Secondly, the impact font has a heavy feel to it, and the squeezing between the letters can create some tension. I think it's possible to make the viewer aware of this and realize that it could be negative. Here is my simulation in illustrate.<br>

### Neutral:<br>

Regarding the choice of fonts for neutral emotions, I don't think fonts reflect emotions. However, I immediately thought of HELVETICA as one of the most popular fonts in the world. HELVETICA is arguably everywhere, from slogans to company logos.<br>

[How Helvetica Conquered The World With Its Cool, Comforting Logic](https://www.fastcompany.com/1665881/how-helvetica-conquered-the-world-with-its-cool-comforting-logic)<br>

In my project, HELVETICA will play to its strengths: no decoration, no emotion, just a clear presentation of information. In the test, HELVETICA seemed to be quietly narrating a story.<br>

### Positive:<br>
Regarding font choices for positive emotions, in [The Psychology of Fonts (Fonts That Evoke Emotion)](https://design.tutsplus.com/articles/the-psychology-of-fonts--cms-34943), I learned that this is a friendly choice for positive emotions due to the Sans Serif's friendly psychological association font.<br>

While searching for the right Sans Serif font, I found Manrope. The style of this one is lively and not overdone. I was immediately attracted to the font's relaxed and lively style, especially when it displays curved letters, especially the word 'ground.' Thanks to Mikhail Sharanda for the design and open source. [This is the font's GitHub page.](https://github.com/sharanda/manrope)
