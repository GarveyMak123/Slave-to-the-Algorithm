# WEEK 9
***
### Milestone
During the week, I missed the milestone presentation. It is because I wasted a lot of time trying to get trending, hashtag, and tweeting data via API. However, I realized that the data acquisition and sentiment analysis was complicated, especially since I had never worked with programming before. What made me anxious was that it was already Week 9. The cornerstone of my project - the data - I had not yet succeeded in solving. 

As a result, I had to change my strategy and make the way I acquired the data as simple as possible. Eventually, I recorded the Excel data with trends, labels, and sentiments, and my project finally took its first real step.

### Project process

While looking for ways to get data on Twitter trends, hashtags, and sentiment in an easily accessible way, it occurred to me that in [The Coding Train's 13.5: Tabular Data - Processing Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woaR-CJEwqc), the data he uses is downloaded in a spreadsheet format. Does this mean that I might be able to keep track of the data in a spreadsheet format?

#### Trends and Hashtags
By Googling Twitter trending, I discovered that [trends24](https://trends24.in/) and [getdaytrends](https://getdaytrends.com/2020-09-24/12/) provide real-time Twitter trending topics and hashtags around the world. So I decided to record these trends and topic hashtags one by one in Excel. Finally, I recorded 48 trends and hashtags.<br>
