# WEEK 7

### Project progress

After all this research, I think my "A Tool" project concept is bloated and confusing. In the concept, either a generative poster or logo can be extracted separately and developed into a project. So this week, I'm in a situation was faced with a choice: 1. simplify the idea and continue to develop it, or 2. re-invent the wheel with a new project.

While wandering around the Internet, I started thinking about what it means to be a designer. Until I came across a video in which the author argued that a good designer's work needs to have meaning, it's a concern for society and humanity or philosophical and critical inspiration. It is through these perspectives that one can create a work with a soul.

Unfortunately, I forgot the video's name, but the ideas in it had an impact on me. I started to conceive of a new project. I wanted to bring a social and humanity perspective on my concept. If I could make some impact, my project would be meaningful to the social or human aspects, even if insignificant.

### New start

While browsing social media apps such as Weibo and Twitter over the last few years, I have noticed that tweets under trends and hashtags are full of emotions, both positive and negative. I think the emotions in these tweets can have an emotional impact on other people, indirectly influencing people's judgment of an event or person.

Today, with algorithms, people only see what they want to see. For example, I stumbled upon a topic I was interested in on social media. When I click in to browse because the algorithm recommends it, the next thing I see is a related topic in the social media interface. Over time, social media software creates a cocoon of information. These cocoons of information cover topics that interest me and are continually being pushed. While these companies set out to keep users in their products longer, the negative result is the formation of information cocoons.

Regarding the emotions that abound under trends and hashtags, even though users don't start from a desire to influence others in social media, they just want to give their opinion on things or people. But in social media, often emotionally charged tweets are the most contagious, and usually popular tweets are emotionally charged. Combined with these factors, people are easily influenced by opinions and emotions, directly or indirectly influencing their judgments about things or people.

Therefore, the concept of my project is to visualize the emotions of Twitter trends and hashtags. To inspire people to take a dispassionate look at trends and hashtags in social media and think and research things independently. Through research, we will get closer to the truth, won't we?

### Project planning<br>
1. Access to data (trends, hashtags, relevant tweets)
2. Sentiment analysis
3. Visualization in Processing

### Class Activities
In class activities, we write pseudocode.

make coffee:<br>

Function make coffee<br>
INPUT coffee powder<br>
IF bitter<br>
   add milk, sugar<br>
END IF tastes good<br>

### Project pseudocodeï¼š

```java
FUNCTION visualization


INPUT data
OUTPUT visualization

IF emotion1
    color 1
    visualization 1

IF emotion 2
    color 2
    visualization 2

IF emotion 3
    color 3
    visualization 3

END IF
```
