## 12 Hour Challenge
***
In my daily life, I often use spotify to listen to music. So I decided to use spotify as my **12 Hour Challenge**.

### Rules:
1. Flip a coin, **Heads** means headphones connected, **Tails** means using speakers.
2. Flip a coin, **Heads** means random play, **Tails** means repeat.
3. Select **20 sides** of the dice, and the number on each side represents the number of clicks on the next song.

### Result

1.![Tails: using speakers](https://github.com/GarveyMak123/Slave-to-the-Algorithm/blob/master/week%202/1.png)
2.![Tails: repeat](https://github.com/GarveyMak123/Slave-to-the-Algorithm/blob/master/week%202/2.png)
