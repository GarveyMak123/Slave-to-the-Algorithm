# WEEK 1

On holiday, I watched some videos on UI and UX. The advice in the videos was that learning UI requires some programming base. The designer in one of the videos mentioned the concept of generative design. This course will be the beginning of my journey into generative design learning.

### Group Activity

In the group activity, we created parameters. Our group decided to roll the dice to create the design. The rules were that each of the 8 sides of the dice represented the color (black or red), the direction and the symbols. I then decided to roll 30 times and write down the numbers first and eventually connect the symbols.
