# WEEK 10
***
After importing the data into PROCESSING, it meant that I finally had a breakthrough in my project. Although I don't consider my data acquisition and data import to be a 'success,' as in the original idea, I was hoping to implement real-time data import and visualization in my project. 

However, visualizing this data and communicating my project's meaning is even more important in the coming weeks. Therefore, this week I will continue to develop the project, focusing on visualizing these data.

### Project progress
Based on last week's test, I used the color definitions to define a table where neutral equals color 0, negative equals color 1, and positive equals color 2. These colors are blue (0,0,255), red (255,0,0), and green (0,255,0).<br>

Since this project's data is based on Twitter, I had the whim to import Twitter logos and display these trends and hashtags in the logos.<br>

But I immediately regretted it, because it seemed so stupid. So I started working on some artwork for emotional visualization. I hope to get some inspiration from these works.


### Emotional visualization artwork

1.Amygdala<br>
The Fuse Studio<br>
CUBO Centro Unipol in Bologna, Italy<br>

"Amygdala" processes 30 tweets per second and transforms them into six emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, disgust, surprise, or fear. These emotions are shown through sound textures.<br>

2.Monolitt<br>
Syver Lauritzen and Eirik Haugen Murvol, 2014 <br>

"Monolitt", was created by analyzing the emotions in local social media and assigning them to corresponding colors of paint. Use the corresponding paint to create a map of social media activity.<br>

I was inspired by these works, especially 'Monolitt', and I think that the visual impact on the audience is key to my projects. However, these visual impacts need to be restrained. I don't want the audience to be influenced emotionally and be the first to see these trends and hashtags.

While thinking about making these text visually impactful, I came up with the Windows XP Starfield screensaver, which has been etched in my memory since I was a child. When I was little, when the computer at home was in standby mode, these stars started to appear on the screen and kept flying towards me.<br>

### Research
For more information on how to implement the Starfield effect in processing, I watched [The Coding Train's Coding Challenge #1: The Starry Night in Processing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17WoOqgXsRM&t=3s), as well as downloaded and referenced code from [this page](https://cs.brynmawr.edu/Courses/cs110/spring2016dx/examples/12/starfield/), and [Marco's work in the OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/304221/).

### Project progress 2
Based on the previous code, I started making my 'Starfield'.
