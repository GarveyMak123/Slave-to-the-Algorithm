# WEEK 10
***
After importing the data into PROCESSING, it meant that I finally had a breakthrough in my project. Although I don't consider my data acquisition and data import to be a 'success,' as in the original idea, I was hoping to implement real-time data import and visualization in my project. 

However, visualizing this data and communicating my project's meaning is even more important in the coming weeks. Therefore, this week I will continue to develop the project, focusing on visualizing these data.

### Project progress
Based on last week's test, I used the color definitions to define a table where neutral equals color 0, negative equals color 1, and positive equals color 2. These colors are blue (0,0,255), red (255,0,0), and green (0,255,0).<br>

Since this project's data is based on Twitter, I had the whim to import Twitter logos and display these trends and hashtags in the logos.<br>
