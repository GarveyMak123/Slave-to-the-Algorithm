This week, I'll be working on font color combinations and sound effects. And finish my project.

### Project Progress

While searching for previous connections between color and emotion, in [Influence with Design - A Guide to Color and Emotions](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/colors-and-emotions), I initially learned that warm colors (yellow, red, and orange) are considered positive. In contrast, cool colors (blue, green, and purple) are considered negative.<br>

As my research progressed, I learned that bright, warm colors convey positive emotions. Therefore, I chose orange to represent positive emotions. Orange is positive and balanced - it portrays energy, but it can also be inviting and friendly. In [Colors and emotions: how colors make you feel](https://99designs.com.au/blog/tips/how-color-impacts-emotions-and-behaviors/), Afroz Nawaf's orange street photos make me feel energized.
