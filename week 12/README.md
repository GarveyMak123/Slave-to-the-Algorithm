### Project Progress

While searching for previous connections between color and emotion, in [Influence with Design - A Guide to Color and Emotions](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/colors-and-emotions), I initially learned that warm colors (yellow, red, and orange) are considered positive. In contrast, cool colors (blue, green, and purple) are considered negative.<br>

As my research progressed, I learned that bright, warm colors convey positive emotions. Therefore, I chose orange to represent positive emotions. Orange is positive and balanced - it portrays energy, but it can also be inviting and friendly. In [Colors and emotions: how colors make you feel](https://99designs.com.au/blog/tips/how-color-impacts-emotions-and-behaviors/), Afroz Nawaf's orange street photos make me feel energized.<br>

Regarding the color of neutral emotions, white is the most neutral of all colors. Therefore, when using white as the neutral emotion color, the viewer has no emotional impact on the work.<br>

About the negative colors. The effective use of colors for negative emotions is found in the paintings of Pablo Picasso, who painted in monochromatic blue between 1901 and 1904, which reflected his depressed state of mind. Therefore, I think it is a good idea to choose blue as a negative mood.<br>
