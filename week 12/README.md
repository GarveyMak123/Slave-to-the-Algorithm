# WEEK 12
***
This week, I'll be working on font color combinations and sound effects. And finish my project.

### Project Progress
#### color
While searching for previous connections between color and emotion, in [Influence with Design - A Guide to Color and Emotions](https://www.toptal.com/designers/ux/colors-and-emotions), I initially learned that warm colors (yellow, red, and orange) are considered positive. In contrast, cool colors (blue, green, and purple) are considered negative.<br>

As my research progressed, I learned that bright, warm colors convey positive emotions. Therefore, I chose orange to represent positive emotions. Orange is positive and balanced - it portrays energy, but it can also be inviting and friendly. In [Colors and emotions: how colors make you feel](https://99designs.com.au/blog/tips/how-color-impacts-emotions-and-behaviors/), Afroz Nawaf's orange street photos make me feel energized.<br>

Regarding the color of neutral emotions, white is the most neutral of all colors. Therefore, when using white as the neutral emotion color, the viewer has no emotional impact on the work.<br>

About the negative colors. The effective use of colors for negative emotions is found in the paintings of Pablo Picasso, who painted in monochromatic blue between 1901 and 1904, which reflected his depressed state of mind. Therefore, I think it is a good idea to choose blue as a negative mood.<br>

In Processing, I changed the colors—Orange for positive, neutral for white, and negative for blue. To be able to see these trends and labels clearly, I added transparency to the colors.<br>

#### BGM
After finishing the fonts and colors, I considered using sound effects to add to the project Starfield atmosphere. I wanted to add some spatial music for the sound effects that would make the audience feel as if they were in space and filled with tranquility.

In [Bensound](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/slow-motion), I found the music I was looking for, called Slow Motion, which is royalty-free. The author is Benjamin Tissot (also known as Bensound). I needed to cite sources in the project.<br>

While importing the music using libraries Sound, I have a problem. The sound was very noisy, and after checking the code, it was still not resolved. Eventually, in [Curtis's processing: how to play music using minim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsADo2gcPWE), I learned how to use the minim library to import music and solve the problem.<br>
